About The Project
This repository is a place for volunteers to contribute community translations.
You can contribute new translations, fixes to existing translations, or point out errors by creating an Issue.

Getting Started
Before beginning the effort, it is very highly recommended to communicate your intent at #stardeus-translations on Stardeus Discord, or by creating an issue here on GitHub. If the language has multiple contributors, or if the language is already under active translation, the work could end up conflicting with others, so it's best to communicate before starting and get a confirmation.
Contribute in small chunks rather than in one big update, this way it's easier to collaborate and merge the efforts from different people.

The Source file
You can find the source file here.
The recommended way of translating is to make a copy of the source sheet, modify the "Translation" column (please don't modify any other columns), then download.

Contributing
Contributions are awesome! Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.
