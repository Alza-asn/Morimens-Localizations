1. Download the "Source Sheets.xlsx" file from 01_SOURCE folder.

2. Locate the part you want to contribute. Copy and paste those rows into a new excel sheet.

3. Put your translation in the "Translation" column, and keep all the other columns intact;
*The source sheet comes with existing English translation. 
If you are working on other languages, simply delete the English translation, and replace it with your language's translation. 
No need to create a new row next to the English translation.

4. After you finish, save the file in .csv format, and upload your translation contribution to the corresponding language folder. 

We recommend naming your upload file like this:
[Language]_[Content]_[Type].csv

[Language]: please use the shortform language codes: EN, RU, ES, KR, etc.
[Type]: tell us if it is a Translation from Chinese or Proofreading of existing translation. 

Example: EN_StoryChapter3_Proofreading.csv

Github automatically records your name, upload date, and all previous file versions.

5. IMPORTANT NOTE:

1) Please make sure you only edited the TRANSLATION column. Please don't delete or edit other columns!

2) We recommend only uploading the part you worked on. No need to provide the whole source text sheet again.
