Item_89954_Desc,d道具_Item_A.csv,Item,Desc,可爱的房间，精美的家具，绒绒的毯子，华丽的裙摆，端庄的礼仪。淑女墨菲被慷慨地赐予他人望尘莫及的地位和垂涎以求的珍宝，却始终生活如行尸走肉。\n\n某个无人知晓的夜里，她悄悄躲在废弃的衣柜中，被蹈海者的鱼人们摇摇晃晃地抬出教会，弃置在一片荒无人烟的郊野中。\n\n她推开衣柜，旷野星光灿烂。\n她跃过杂物的小山，在山脚拾到一枚小球。\n\n当戈利亚带着惊惶的鱼人小队找到遗失的圣女时，她仍坐在距离衣柜不远的地方，将手中的小球高高抛起，等小球滚落，再一次高高抛起——\n戈利亚半句话也没有询问，就将圣女重新押回了名为供奉的牢笼。\n所以她所作所为的目的，始终不曾言说，直至将匕首刺入胸膛的时刻，也一直埋藏在心底。\n\n——她想将球抛上又大又圆的月亮。\n——那样的话，它就不必再落下了。,"A lovely room. Exquisite furniture. Plush rugs. Flowing skirts. Perfect manners. Lady Murphy was generously granted a status others could only dream of, along with treasures they would kill to possess. Yet she lived as though hollowed out, drifting through life like a soulless husk.\n\nOne night, unseen by any, she hid inside an abandoned wardrobe.\nThe fishmen of the Seafarers cult carried it, swaying and creaking, out of the church and left it in the middle of a desolate field.\n\nShe pushed open the wardrobe. Above her, the starlit wilderness glittered.\nShe skipped over a hill of discarded junk, and at its foot, found a small ball.\n\nWhen Goliath finally arrived with his panicked squad of fishmen to retrieve the missing Holy Maiden, they found her not far from the wardrobe, seated in the grass.\nShe tossed the ball high into the air, watched it fall, and tossed it again, higher still.\nGoliath didn't ask a single question. He simply brought her back—back to the prison they called a shrine.\nAnd so her reasons were never spoken, until the day she drove that dagger into her chest. They remained buried in silence.\n\n—That night, she had wanted to throw her ball to the moon. That great, round moon.\n—So high up in the sky, so it wouldn't have to fall back down again."
