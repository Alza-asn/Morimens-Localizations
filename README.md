<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome, Keeper! 
This repository is a place for volunteers to contribute community translations for Morimens. Thank you so much for your generous help.

You can contribute new translations or proofread edits to existing machine translations by creating an <a href="https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues">Issue</a>.

Before making a Pull Request, please make sure your GitHub name is the same as the name you entered in your Volunteer Application Form.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Before beginning the effort, it is very highly recommended to communicate your intent in the Morimens Volunteer Translation discord with fellow volunteers who work on the same language, or open an issue on Github. If the language has multiple contributors, or if the language is already under active translation, the work could end up conflicting with others, so it's best to communicate before starting and get a confirmation.
2. Contribute in small chunks rather than in one big update, this way it's easier to collaborate and merge the efforts from different people.
3. It is recommended to check out the [existing Term Base and Style Guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1NVBQGdhmr6w6tx9RzpX-BDKxdQD-MX9m) before getting started.
   
### The Source Files

You can find the source files <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1sOyopUbBhgpdZbew2WezbOrwXlmK0OoC">here</a>.
The recommended way of translating/editing is to make a copy of the source sheet, modify the "Translation" column (please don't modify any other columns), then download.
Please note that you may not find the entirety of the source text files here, as we cannot leak future content. 
If you want to work on a certain part of content, but does not find the corresponding source file, please open an Issue on GitHub, or notify @艾絲Ace on Discord.
