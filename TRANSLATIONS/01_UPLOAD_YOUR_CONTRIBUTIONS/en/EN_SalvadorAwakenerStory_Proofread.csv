Subsequently, the Keeper took over Salvador's link, and ""The Blessing"" healed all individuals present, preventing any casualties.\nIt was then discovered that Bishop Salvador's original linker was the former Bishop of the Church District, now the Archbishop of Londinium ■■■■■.\nIn A.F. 300, the Archbishop had accidentally awakened Salvador after coming into contact with the Holy Ash. Over the next five years, Salvador had served as an assistant priest in the Church District, succeeding him as the Bishop of the Church District following ■■■■■'s promotion.\nAfter the incident, the Keeper agreed to keep Bishop Salvador's Awakener identity confidential; thus, this information was not shared with the Mystia Treaty Committee. Currently, apart from the core personnel of Mythag University, no one is aware of his identity as an Awakener."

Students would also seek his counsel, inquiring if the Bishop would lend an ear to their troubles and woes. Even the seemingly cold and strong Awakeners and knowledgable professors approach the Bishop when he has free time: either to share their nightmares or to discuss the truths of the Soul.\nHis patience is unending, never tiring; Anyone may find acceptance and warmth with him.\n""Of course, my child, is there aught I can do for you?"""

Before the deluge, 'The Blessing Bishop' came from the Central Church, and in his devotion and kindness, established the only orphanage in the area, sheltering the many sick and displaced refugees during a devastating plague.\nThe plague was fierce, sparing noone from its wrath. The bishop prayed day and night, eventually receiving the Father's blessing—a life-giving tablet. He performed miracles, resurrecting the dead and healing those gravely ill from the plague, using his own flesh and blood as divine offerings. Yet regardless of his miracles, this benevolent bishop was framed as a cohort of demons, and ultimately sentenced to death by burning at the stake.\nCoincidentally, during the same period, there were reports of a 'Blood Heretic' in the central @2 (now near Bondos in the southern Constante Federation). According to the 'Continental Inquisition Heresy Records,' this heretic held a tablet marked with demonic symbols, performing rituals with flesh and blood, and conducting wicked ceremonies on moonless nights. The heretic was captured by the Inquisition in 107 BD,and in his sincere repentance to the Father, was also sentenced to death by burning at the stake.\n Undeniably, there are many similarities between 'The Blessing Bishop' and the 'Blood Heretic': The same era, same region, same use of tablets and rituals. Considering the Inquisition's strong subjectivity, it is likely they stigmatized certain individuals as heretics. If we were to believe coincidences, the legendary 'Blessing Bishop' might have indeed been real, possibly even the 'Blood Heretic' recorded by the Inquisition...""\n—Excerpt from 'Our Gods: Religion and Folk Beliefs in Southern Constante Federation'\n"
